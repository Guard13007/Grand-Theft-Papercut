# [Grand Theft Papercut](http://guard13007.itch.io/grand-theft-papercut)

Grand Theft Advance knock-off, using [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) and cards as a weapon. For the 32nd Ludum Dare. [View this game's entry!](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=52323) Also on [Itch.io](http://guard13007.itch.io/grand-theft-papercut).

Note: If you try to use "run src.bat" to run it, it requires [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) (64 bit version) to be installed.

## Controls

WASD to move up, left, down, right.

Play: Walk into an NPC to fight them with a card mini-game. Click the cards in your hand (lowest row of cards) and then your field (the row above that) to play them. (Note: Currently crashes after the NPC runs out of cards. I need to fix that. >.>)

Editor: opens tiles.lua (from the save directory) and allows you to modify it.
Scroll up or down to select tiles, right click copies a tile, left click pastes.
