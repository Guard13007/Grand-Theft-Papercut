# Grand-Theft-Papercut

Grand Theft Advance knock-off, using [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) and cards as a weapon. For Ludum Dare 32.

Note: If you try to use "run src.bat" to run it, it requires LÖVE (64 bit version) to be installed.
I will make a packaged version later (using [LovePackaging](https://github.com/Guard13007/LovePackaging)).

## Controls

WASD to move up, left, down, right.

Right now is just an editor that opens tiles.lua (from the save directory) and allows you to modify it.
Scroll up or down to select tiles, right click copies a tile, left click pastes.
